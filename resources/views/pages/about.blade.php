                    <div class="col-12">

                        <p>I am a self-taught 2D/3D artist from Hungary with a deep passion for both traditional and
                            digital art. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science and have traveled worldwide,
                            ultimately moving to England to enhance my English skills. When the opportunity arose, I
                            transitioned from my web developer job to pursue my lifelong passion for art. Known for my
                            strong communication skills and exceptional work ethic, I consistently meet deadlines and
                            thrive in both collaborative and independent work environments. Currently, I am dedicated to
                            honing my core artistic skills and technical abilities as I make a career shift into the
                            animation industry as a character artist.
                        </p>

                        <p>I gained valuable experience working under the
                            mentorship of Senior Artist Rafael D. Zuban (<a href="www.rafilm.hu">www.rafilm.hu</a>),
                            where I developed 3D scenes in
                            Blender using Subdivision Modeling techniques while managing post-production with Photoshop
                            and Affinity Photo to adhere to quality standards. Please visit my Artstation account to see

                        <p>
                            My ultimate aim is to become a skilled character designer, this is why I chose to further my
                            education by focusing on 2D character creation.
                            I have successfully completed courses from CGMA, Schoolism, and Domestika, and I remain
                            actively engaged in ongoing learning. I have had the privilege of being mentored by industry
                            professionals, including Wouter Tulp and Daniel Schier, and I am currently receiving
                            guidance from Vagner Farias to further enhance my skills.

                            dedicate an entire year to self-study in 3D modeling using Blender. During this time, I
                            focused on mastering the intricacies of the software. Building on that foundation, I
                            continued my education in 2D art, exploring foundational art principles and character design
                            to develop a well-rounded skill set.
