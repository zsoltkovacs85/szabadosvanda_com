                        <p>I am a self-taught 2D/3D artist from Hungary, with a passion for both traditional and digital
                            art. I
                            earned a master's degree in Computer Science, travelled worldwide, and moved to England to
                            further
                            improve
                            my English. When I finally had the opportunity, I quit my web developer job to follow my
                            passion,
                            which
                            has been present since childhood. I am a strong communicator with an outstanding work ethic
                            and the
                            ability to meet deadlines consistently. Successful in working as part of a team and skilled
                            at
                            working
                            independently. I currently focus on developing core art skills and technical abilities,
                            and
                            I am working
                            hard
                            on making a career switch to the Animation Industry as a character artist.

                        <p>
                            I spent one year gaining experience in working under direct supervision with Senior Artist
                            Rafael
                            D.Zuban ( <a href="www.rafilm.hu">www.rafilm.hu</a>) to meet deadlines and quality
                            standards,
                            building
                            3d scenes in Blender with
                            Subdivision Modeling technique and using Photoshop/Affinity Photo for the post-production of
                            the
                            final
                            piece. Please see the <a

                            However, my real passion is character creation, which is why I continued my studies with art
                            fundamentals and 2D character design. I am present on two online course platforms,
                            Schoolism
                            and
                            Domestika to further my skills. Furthermore I completed an anatomy course on CGMA with Rey
                            Bustos,
                            completed a few weeks mentoring with Wouter Tulp and currently I am receiving
                            feedback
                            on my studies from Vagner Farias, animation director.
