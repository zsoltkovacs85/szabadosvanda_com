            <div class="col-12 mb-5">

                <p>I am a self-taught 2D/3D artist from Hungary, with a passionfor both traditional and digital art. I
                    earned a master's degreein Computer Science, travelled worldwide, and moved toEngland to further
                    improve
                    my English. When I finally had the opportunity, I quit my web developer job to follow mypassion,
                    which
                    has been present since childhood. I am a strongcommunicator with an outstanding work ethic and the
                    abilityto meet deadlines consistently. Successful in working as part of a team and skilled at
                    working
                    independently. Currentlyfocusing on developing core art skills and technical abilities, and working
                    hard
                    on making a career switch to the Animationindustry as a character designer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I spent one year gaining experience in working under direct supervision with Senior Artist Rafael
                    D.Zuban ( <a href="www.rafilm.hu"><b>www.rafilm.hu</b></a>) to meet deadlines and quality standards,
                    building
                    3d scenes in Blender with
                    Subdivision Modelingtechnique and using Photoshop/Affinity Photo for the post-production of the
                    final
                    piece. However, my real passion is character creation, which is why I continued my studies withart
                    fundamentals and 2D character design. I am present on twoonline course platforms, Schoolism and
                    Domestika to furthermy skills. Furthermore I completed an anatomy course onCGMA with Rey Bustos,
                    completed a few weeks mentoring with Wouter Tulp and currently I am being led by and receiving
                    feedback
                    on my 2D studies from Vagner Farias, animation director
