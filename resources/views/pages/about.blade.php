            <p>I am a self-taught 2D/3D artist from Hungary, with a passionfor both traditional and digital art. I
                earned a master's degreein Computer Science, travelled worldwide, and moved toEngland to further improve
                my English. When I finally had the opportunity, I quit my web developer job to follow mypassion, which
                has been present since childhood. I am a strongcommunicator with an outstanding work ethic and the
                abilityto meet deadlines consistently. Successful in working as part of a team and skilled at working
                independently. Currentlyfocusing on developing core art skills and technical abilities, and working hard
                on making a career switch to the Animationindustry as a character designer.

            <p>
                I spent one year gaining experience in working under direct supervision with Senior Artist Rafael
                D.Zuban ( <a href="www.rafilm.hu">www.rafilm.hu</a>) to meet deadlines and quality standards, building 3d scenes in Blender with
                Subdivision Modelingtechnique and using Photoshop/Affinity Photo for the post-production of the final
                piece. However, my real passion is character creation, which is why I continued my studies withart
                fundamentals and 2D character design. I am present on twoonline course platforms, Schoolism and
                Domestika to furthermy skills. Furthermore I completed an anatomy course onCGMA with Rey Bustos,
                completed a few weeks mentoring with Wouter Tulp and currently I am being led by and receiving feedback
                on my 2D studies from Vagner Farias, animation director
