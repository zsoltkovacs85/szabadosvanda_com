                    <div class="col-12">

                        <p>I am a self-taught 2D/3D artist from Hungary, with a passion for both traditional and digital
                            art. I
                            earned a master's degree in Computer Science, travelled worldwide, and moved to England to
                            further
                            improve
                            my English. When I finally had the opportunity, I quit my web developer job to follow my
                            passion,
                            which
                            has been present since childhood. I am a strong communicator with an outstanding work ethic
                            and the
                            ability to meet deadlines consistently. Successful in working as part of a team and skilled
                            at
                            working
                            independently. Currently focusing on developing core art skills and technical abilities, and
                            working
                            hard
                            on making a career switch to the Animation industry as a character designer.

                        <p>
                            I spent one year gaining experience in working under direct supervision with Senior Artist
                            Rafael
                            D.Zuban ( <a href="www.rafilm.hu"><b>www.rafilm.hu</b></a>) to meet deadlines and quality
                            standards,
                            building
                            3d scenes in Blender with
                            Subdivision Modeling technique and using Photoshop/Affinity Photo for the post-production of
                            the
                            final
                            piece (<a href="https://www.artstation.com/vanda_szabados_requena/albums/2781196"

                            However, my real passion is character creation, which is why I continued my studies with art
                            fundamentals and 2D character design. I am present on two on line course platforms, Schoolism
                            and
                            Domestika to further my skills. Furthermore I completed an anatomy course on CGMA with Rey
                            Bustos,
                            completed a few weeks mentoring with Wouter Tulp and currently I am being led by and
                            receiving
                            feedback
                            on mystudies from Vagner Farias, animation director.
